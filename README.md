# spydis
A simple package for calculating drought indices based on time-series remote sensing and gridded datasets.
# Main features
This package focuses on calculating some commonly used drought indices from remote sensing and meteorological perspectives:
- **Remote sensing-based drought indices**
	- VCI: Vegetation condition index. Details can be found [here](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01431169608949106)
	- TCI: Temperature condition index
	- VHI: Vegetation health index
	- VAI: Vegetation anomaly index
- **Meteorological drought indices**
	- SPI: Standardized precipitation index
	- SPEI: Standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index
